# BLOCKCHAIN MASTERCLASS - CIRCLE API IMPLEMENTATION

## Project Summary

- The program codes in this project will help you understand how circle uses APIs to settle financial transactions involving crypto currencies, fiat currencies and the platform's own stablecoin-USDC.

## Problem Statement

- Currently, most economies do not have financial systems that provide faster transaction exchanges between crypto and fiat currencies.

## Solution

- This is where circle APIs and SDK are handy, as they seal this gap and offer more flexible means of transacting with different currencies.

## Installations 
- Ensure nodejs is installed in your machine. if not, visit here and install according to your operating system: https://nodejs.org/en/download
- Clone the project to your local machine.
- Navigate to the project directory.
- npm install @circle-fin/circle-sdk --save
- Run `npm install` to install all the dependencies.

## Languages

- Nodejs
- Javascript

### Getting Started

- Create and store safely circle API key by visiting the Sandbox API endpoint link- https://api-sandbox.circle.com
- Save the account credentials/environment variables in .env file of your project.
- Store the .env file in the gitignore file so that it's not pushed to the repo with the other necessary files.
